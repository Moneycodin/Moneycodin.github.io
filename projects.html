        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>Customer Churn Prediction for E-commerce:
	•Utilized historical customer data to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques. Performed extensive data analysis, feature engineering, and employed a Random 	Forest classifier
	•Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting customer churn. Developed actionable insights and recommendations for customer retention strategies, leading to a significant reduction in 	churn rate
 
	Time Series Forecasting for Stock Price Prediction:
	•Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data, including features like trading volume and news sentiment. Employed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to 	model time series patterns
	•Created an accurate forecasting model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1%. The model's predictions were integrated into the investment application, resulting in 	improved decision-making

	Natural Language Processing (NLP) Sentiment Analysis for Social Media:
	•Scraped and processed social media data, performed sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, and visualized trends using interactive dashboards. Utilized Python, and Tableau for 	analysis and visualization
	•Developed an interactive dashboard that allowed real-time monitoring of sentiment trends. Provided actionable insights to clients for brand reputation management and marketing 	strategies

	Image Classification for Object Recognition
	•Developed a computer vision system using deep learning and CNN
	•Accomplished good ML model measured by achieving an accuracy rate of over 95% by training on a comprehensive and diverse image dataset

	Fake News Detection with BERT Fine-tuning
	•Developed a sophisticated fake news detection system by fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM), such as BERT, to categorize news articles inro fake or true
	•Leveraged the LLM's contextual understanding and deep learning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in distinguishing between fake and authentic news articles
	•Attained exceptional accuracy and reliability in identifying fake news across diverse datasets, emphasizing precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
