            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Customer Churn Prediction for E-commerce</h3>
                <p>Utilized historical customer data to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques. Performed extensive data
                    analysis, feature engineering, and employed a Random Forest classifier.</p>
                <p>Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting customer churn. Developed actionable insights and recommendations for customer
                    retention strategies, leading to a significant reduction in churn rate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Time Series Forecasting for Stock Price Prediction</h3>
                <p>Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data, including features like trading volume and news sentiment.
                    Employed an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to model time series patterns.</p>
                <p>Created an accurate forecasting model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1%. The model's predictions were
                    integrated into the investment application, resulting in improved decision-making.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP) Sentiment Analysis for Social Media</h3>
                <p>Scraped and processed social media data, performed sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, and visualized trends using
                    interactive dashboards. Utilized Python and Tableau for analysis and visualization.</p>
                <p>Developed an interactive dashboard that allowed real-time monitoring of sentiment trends. Provided actionable insights to
                    clients for brand reputation management and marketing strategies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Image Classification for Object Recognition</h3>
                <p>Developed a computer vision system using deep learning and CNN.</p>
                <p>Accomplished a good ML model measured by achieving an accuracy rate of over 95% by training on a comprehensive and
                    diverse image dataset.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Fake News Detection with BERT Fine-tuning</h3>
                <p>Developed a sophisticated fake news detection system by fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM), such as BERT, to
                    categorize news articles into fake or true.</p>
                <p>Leveraged the LLM's contextual understanding and deep learning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in
                    distinguishing between fake and authentic news articles.</p>
                <p>Attained exceptional accuracy and reliability in identifying fake news across diverse datasets, emphasizing precision,
                    recall, and F1-score metrics.</p>
