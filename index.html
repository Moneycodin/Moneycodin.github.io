        <h2>Talking about myself</h2>
        <p>I am trained in nanotechnology, synthesized nanomaterials for various applications like sensing, energy, and others. I have expertise in new product development in the broad range of nanomaterials via re-precipitation, hydrothermal, and solid-state synthesis resulting in 5 publications, 5 conference presentations, and 1 international scholarship worth Â£37880 (64,497.78 CAD). However, during the COVID break with the closing of most in-person work and the rising of more remote job opportunities, my interest started developing in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
